Enhancing Image Captioning Accuracy Using Different Models
In today's digital age, the fusion of computer vision and natural language processing has unlocked profound 
possibilities, particularly in the realm of image understanding and interpretation. One of the most 
fascinating applications to emerge from this intersection is image captioning â€“ a process where machines 
generate descriptive textual summaries of visual content. This capability not only facilitates better 
understanding and indexing of images but also opens doors to innovative applications such as content 
recommendation systems, image search engines, and tools for assisting visually impaired individuals. 
However, while the potential of image captioning is immense, its practical deployment poses significant 
challenges, especially when considering resource-constrained edge devices. These devices, ranging from 
smartphones to IoT sensors, often lack the computational horsepower and memory capacity to 
accommodate the resource-intensive deep neural networks typically employed for image captioning tasks. 
As a result, there exists a pressing need to develop efficient and lightweight solutions that can deliver 
accurate image descriptions while operating within the constraints of edge computing environments. 
To address this need, our project focuses on designing and implementing a novel image captioning system 
optimized for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art 
deep learning architectures and advanced compression techniques to strike a balance between model 
efficiency and captioning performance. 
At the heart of our system lies a sophisticated neural network architecture consisting of a ResNet101 
encoder and an LSTM decoder. The ResNet101 encoder is responsible for extracting rich visual features 
from input images, while the LSTM decoder generates coherent textual descriptions based on these 
extracted features. This architecture has been chosen for its proven effectiveness in capturing intricate visual 
details and generating contextually relevant captions. 
In addition to the core encoder-decoder architecture, we incorporate the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image 
Pretraining) model into our system. CLIP enhances the semantic understanding of images and captions by 
learning to associate them in a joint embedding space, enabling more nuanced and contextually rich image 
descriptions. 
To further optimize our system for deployment on edge devices, we explore cutting-edge compression 
techniques such as pruning. Pruning involves selectively removing redundant connections or parameters 
from the neural network. By applying these techniques judiciously, we aim to create a streamlined and 
efficient image captioning system that delivers high-quality captions while minimizing resource 
consumption. 
Throughout this report, we provide a comprehensive overview of our project, detailing the design and 
implementation of our image captioning system, the methodologies employed for training and evaluation, 
and the experimental results obtained. Our findings not only demonstrate the feasibility of deploying image 
captioning systems on resource-constrained edge devices but also showcase the potential for leveraging 
advanced compression techniques to unlock new possibilities in edge computing applications.
